    <blockquote>Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness that most frightens us. We ask ourselves, Who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented, fabulous? Actually, who are you not to be? You are a child of God. Your playing small does not serve the world. There is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won't feel insecure around you. We are all meant to shine, as children do. We were born to make manifest the glory of God that is within us. It's not just in some of us; it's in everyone. As we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give others permission to do the same. As we are liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others. - Marianne Williamson</blockquote>

      <h2>Mt. Teneriffe</h2>
      <sub>June 2015</sub>
      
      <p>In June 2015 I hiked Mt. Teneriffe which is <strong>14 miles</strong> round trip and <i>4000ft elevation gain</i>. This summit is in the Snoqualmie Mountain Range and has a 360 view at the peak. It has one of the best views east of any of the peaks in this area, making it a great <b>sunrise hike</b>, which is actually how I first did this hike. We started at <u>1:45am</u> and summited around <u>4:30am</u>.</p>
